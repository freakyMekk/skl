        <h1>Investigation</h1>

        <h2>The Need / Problem or Challenge</h2>
        <p>The need/problem solved by my game is that all the most popular video games that keep a consistent player base for years are not innovative. Many times, the companies behind them release a new game, it is an extremely similar version to the game before it, with some small, but major changes that the consistent player base is not happy with. The reason my game solves this issue is because it is not a common game genre. Making games in a smaller genre gives room to innovate and build upon what is already laid down in the community.</p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>My target audience is people who enjoy playing indie games, and groups of friends who want a new game to play.</p>

        <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
        <p>One of my success criteria is receiving reviews from players. Receiving reviews is an effective way to find ways to polish the game and make it more enjoyable for the average player. Another part of my success criteria would be bug reports from players, such as the player being able to escape the boundaries of the game, or the player dying even though the enemy was not close to hitting them.</p>

        <h2>Sustainability or Ethical Issues</h2>
        <p>Limited resources: The largest issue with making games as an independent developer is that I have limited resources to make the game with. You are not a massive game development company, such as Activision or Ubisoft, who have thousands of developers always working on the game, making sure that there are minimal bugs, and the best quality it can be. As an independent developer, it is extremely hard to make sure that my game will be completely functional, optimized, and bug-free on release.</p>
        <p>Marketing and visibility: Being a single developer means that marketing will be an issue as I do not have a large following on social media prior to making the game. Having a following of only a few people is a large factor in having a game with a small player base.</p>
        <p>Competition: The game development scene in the modern day is extremely competitive, as there are thousands of people making games, and this means that there is going to be a lot of competition in making the next popular game. Having a lot of competition makes it harder to get viewed by lots of people because there are hundreds of other games out there, which might appeal to their interests more than yours does.</p>
        <p>Time management: Managing my time as an independent developer is extremely hard, because it means dedicating lots and lots of time to creating the game, which can kill motivation towards development of the game, because I have spent so much time on it.</p>
        <p>Quality assurance: Making sure my game is high quality, while working as a solo developer, is difficult when comparing the effort required (per person working on the game) from a large development studio. The effort required to keep players interested in the game during the development process is immense and can kill motivation if the game starts losing interest from the gaming community.</p>

        <h2>Research of existing products</h2>

        <h3>Hollow Knight</h3>
        <p>Development Studio: Team Cherry</p>
        
        <div class="pros">
            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple game concept, run through the world and fight bosses along the way, as well as talking to NPC’s (non-playable characters) to understand the story of WHY you are doing this.</li>
                <li>Great visual effects, such as a white arc going through the enemy that shows you have damaged them with a slashing attack.</li>
                <li>A simple to understand story, that revolves around the protagonist (you) being chosen as a vessel by the Pale King, the trap the main antagonist, the Radiance, in a pit called, “The Abyss.”</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="cons">
            <h4>Cons:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Long playtime for story completion, average of 27 hours.</li>
                <li>Long 100% game completion time, average of 64 hours.</li>
                <li>The starting part of the game is especially bland, with basic character design and minimal action compared to the later parts of the game.</li>
                <li>The game does not provide the user with directions on where to go or what to do, leaving them to explore and figure out where to go by themselves.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <h4>Takeaway:</h4>
            <p>My takeaway from Hollow Knight is that it is good to have a simple concept of running through a set world and constantly killing enemies, as it keeps players interested and happy with the game. The game is a little bit too long for how simple it is, around 8-12 hours of gameplay for the story would be more suitable. Being more creative with the early game, where everyone gets their first impressions from, is crucial because if the player has a bad first impression, then they will not play through the full game and find the fun and detailed parts later. Not providing the player with directions can be an effective way to make a game, but only if the game is suited for it, such as extremely large open world games like Elden Ring, or any souls-like games. However, with Hollow Knight being in a set world with limited locations to visit, having no directions can be boring because you can become bored of the game trying to find where to go.</p>

        <h3>Elden Ring</h3>
        <p>Development Studio: FromSoftware Inc.</p>

        <div class="pros">
            <h4>Pros:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Character diversity: Elden ring has an extreme amount of character customisation, and hundreds of different combinations for armour sets and weapons. Each combination has its strengths and weaknesses, and the story is completable with any build you can imagine. This amount of customisation is great because it allows for freedom of how YOU want to play the game itself.</li>
                <li>The game has beautiful graphics that leave you wondering how it is possible for a game to look this good. With these graphics comes an attachment to the game that makes every other game look lame in comparison. Cutscenes, which are completely mind-blowingly well-made, create an atmosphere in the game that you will want to experience again once you complete the story.</li>
                <li>Elden Ring has a combat system that blows every other story game out of the water. The advanced mechanics and almost frame-perfect timings to parry or dodge a bosses attacks create a skill cap so high that is its extremely time consuming to reach.</li>
                <li>The story in Elden Ring is one of the longest out of any mainstream story game, taking the average player just over 100 hours of gameplay to complete, which includes killing all the main bosses and talking to every story related NPC. The game includes a feature called “New Game+,” “NG+” for short, which makes you restart the game at a higher difficulty, but with all your gear from the previous playthrough, allowing you to replay the story and gain better gear which is unobtainable during your first playthrough. There are 7 difficulties for NG+, and after that the difficulty stays the same for each new one made.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="cons">
            <h4>Cons:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the major cons with Elden Ring is that the open world feels “dead.” Even with the extreme number of enemies wandering around in the wild in between the locations of each boss fight, there is truly little to do other than constant fighting. A majority of the “open world” aspect of the game is riding around on a horse for a long time to get to each boss arena.</li>
                <li>Another major negative point for the game is that bosses are extremely difficult for any person who has never played a game made by FromSoftware before. Having some of the hardest bosses out of any majorly popular story game is FromSoftware’s trademark for their games. The Dark Souls series and Elden Ring are very unapproachable for the general gamer. Many players that have completed the game since its release in February 2022 have spent hundreds of attempts, even thousands, to beat each boss, only to be rewarded with less than 10 levels to their characters.</li>
                <li>The effort to reward ratio for Elden Ring is especially bad. The currency used to buy levels is called Runes, and it is extremely tedious to gain enough runes to have a good enough stat line to defeat most bosses. Each boss gives up to a maximum of 75 000 runes to use to buy levels with during the first playthrough. Rewards scale for each NG+ until NG+7, but so does difficulty, where they both cap out.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway">
            <h4>Takeaway:</h4>
            <p>My takeaway is that the developers did an amazing job on this game. The combat system is extensive and advanced later in the game, but starting out, it is simple and understandable until you find and unlock new weapons. The graphics have almost no equal, and the map has many beautiful castles along the way through the story, most of which have a boss or mini boss in, which all serve a purpose up until the final part of the story. Each boss has their own place in the story, and the reasons why they are there tie into it. Learning about a boss through it dialogue after you defeat it is a great way of getting intertwined with the story as it is right now and makes the end of the game that much more satisfying, knowing that you know everything and the reasons why events happened before the ending. Having extensive character customisation in the game really helped boost its popularity as each person can play how they want to play. If the player wants to play as a samurai, they can. If they want to play as a mage, they can. While some builds are stronger than others, it can be fun trying out less common builds, which can be exciting to try and beat every boss with, instead of using the best build which does the most damage and makes the game the easiest.</p>

        <div class="overall-takeaway">
            <h3>Overall Takeaway</h3>
            <p>In "Hollow Knight," the author appreciates the game's straightforward yet engaging concept of navigating a set world and defeating enemies, which keeps players interested and happy. However, they find the game a bit too long for its simplicity, suggesting that around 8-12 hours of gameplay would be more suitable to maintain player interest. The author emphasizes the importance of being more creative in the early stages of the game since first impressions are crucial. A poor initial experience might prevent players from continuing through the entire game and discovering the more fun and detailed parts later. The lack of directions is seen as a double-edged sword; while it can enhance the experience in large open-world games like "Elden Ring" or other souls-like games, it can lead to frustration and boredom in "Hollow Knight" due to its more confined world with limited locations to visit.</p>
            <p>In contrast, "Elden Ring" is lauded for its exceptional development. The combat system starts simple and understandable, becoming more extensive and advanced as the game progresses, which helps in keeping players engaged. The game’s graphics are unparalleled, and the map is filled with beautiful castles and diverse landscapes, each contributing to the story by housing a boss or mini boss with a purpose tied to the narrative. Each boss's backstory, revealed through dialogues post-defeat, enriches the storytelling, and makes the game's ending more satisfying as players understand the reasons behind the events. Furthermore, the extensive character customization in "Elden Ring" significantly boosts its popularity, allowing players to tailor their gameplay experience. Whether choosing to play as a samurai, a mage, or experimenting with less conventional builds, players can enjoy a personalized experience. Even though some builds are stronger than others, trying out less common builds adds an exciting challenge and variety, encouraging players to explore different strategies to defeat every boss, rather than just relying on the most powerful builds to make the game easier.</p>
